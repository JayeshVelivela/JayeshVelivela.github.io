# SEO Guide - Making Your Site Discoverable

## Current Status
Your website is deployed, but it won't automatically show up in Google search results. You need to help search engines find and index it.

## Steps to Get Your Site in Search Results

### 1. Submit to Google Search Console (Most Important!)

1. **Get your Railway URL**
   - Your site URL will be something like: `https://personal-website-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
   - Or your custom domain if you added one

2. **Go to Google Search Console**
   - Visit: https://search.google.com/search-console
   - Sign in with your Google account

3. **Add Your Property**
   - Click "Add Property"
   - Enter your website URL
   - Verify ownership (Railway will give you options)

4. **Submit Sitemap** (after verification)
   - Go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
   - Add: `https://your-domain.com/sitemap.xml`
   - Note: Next.js can generate this automatically

### 2. Add Your Website URL to Your Profiles

Add your website URL to these places (helps with discoverability):

- **LinkedIn Profile**: Add to "Website" field in your profile
- **GitHub Profile**: Add to your bio or create a README with the link
- **Email Signature**: Include the link in your email signature
- **Resume**: Add the URL to your resume

### 3. Share Your Site

- Share on social media (LinkedIn, Twitter)
- Add to your GitHub profile README
- Mention it in your job applications

### 4. (Optional) Add a Custom Domain

Having a custom domain like `jayeshvelivela.com` helps:
- More professional
- Easier to remember
- Better for SEO

**To add a custom domain:**
1. Buy a domain (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. In Railway: Settings → Domains → Add Custom Domain
3. Update DNS records as Railway instructs

### 5. Wait for Indexing

- Google typically indexes sites within a few days to a few weeks
- You can check indexing status in Google Search Console
- Be patient - it takes time!

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Deploy site to Railway
- [ ] Submit to Google Search Console
- [ ] Add URL to LinkedIn profile
- [ ] Add URL to GitHub profile
- [ ] Share on social media
- [ ] Add to email signature
- [ ] (Optional) Get custom domain

## Testing Your SEO

1. **Check if indexed**: Search `site:your-domain.com` on Google
2. **Check metadata**: Use browser dev tools or SEO checker tools
3. **Test on mobile**: Google prioritizes mobile-friendly sites

## Additional Tips

- Keep your content updated
- Add new projects as you build them
- Get backlinks (links from other sites to yours)
- Use relevant keywords naturally in your content

## Note About Railway URLs

Railway's default URLs (like `xxxx.up.railway.app`) work fine, but a custom domain (`jayeshvelivela.com`) will:
- Look more professional
- Be easier to share
- Potentially rank better in search

Your site is already optimized with proper meta tags, so once you submit it to Google Search Console, it should start appearing in search results within a few weeks!
